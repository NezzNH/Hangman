# Hangman
Hangman game written in C++

This is a basic hangman game written in C. It isn't cap sensitive, has 3 difficulty levels, and a score system. It has a menu system as well, that I had to make without
goto commands and labels. This is my first venture into cpp, so it might be viewed as very C-like code, and that's because it is. I haven't started reading C++
documentation yet, and thought to just start writing to see what I could do better/different without any prior knowledge. Turns out, not much.
